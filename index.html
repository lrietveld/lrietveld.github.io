    <h2>Graduate, Teacher, Developer, Listener</h2>
    <p> My name is Laura Rietveld. Thank you for visiting my webpage!
      I'm a graduate of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
      My degree is a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science.
      I have about four years of teaching and childcare experience.
      I am seeking a job as an entry level software developer in the Minneapolis area.
      I like kids, and I like working with kids, so I am also looking at opporunities
       to teach abroad again.</p>
