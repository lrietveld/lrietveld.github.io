    <h1>Laura<br>Rietveld</h1>
    <p> I am interested in a software engineering or development position in or near Minneapolis. I’m open to technical support and IT roles or consulting work as well. My education and experience, as well as my desire to build skills and work with a team, would make me a good fit in a variety of cultures and companies.
        <br>I have experience working for a variety of companies such as HelpSystems in Eden Prairie and Country Financial in Arden Hills. I’ve spent the past year teaching high school students AP Computer Science at Eagan High School. Before that, I spent a year teaching English in South Korea with students from
        kindergarten all the way through middle school. Teaching and spending time getting to know students is very rewarding, but I would like to spend the next few years advancing my career as a computer programmer.
        <br>My degree is a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I finished this degree two years early due to my dedication and time spent taking college-level classes in high school. I’ve had two tech internships, and I was a part of the Association for Computing Machinery and ACM-W at my university. I was also a member of the Tau Beta Pi Engineering Society.
        <br>I enjoy using my skills in computer science to create out of the box solutions. I’ve created a Twitterbot to deliver my final project for a journalism class. I’ve created spreadsheets that do calculations to compare renting to buying a house. I’ve also built this webpage using my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.</p>
