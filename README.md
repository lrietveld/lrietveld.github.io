###Author Laura Rietveld
This is a personal portfolio. I was motivated to build this because I want something that represents my skills in software development and design and also represents me.
I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic webpage that responds to resizing and can be converted to an easy to read open dyslexic font created by Abbie Gonzalez.
